The varibles are "ActivityName", "SubjectID", and means and standard derivison of the these sets of data - one has three dimensions: X, Y, Z:

- ActivityName: indicate the activity label 
- SubjectID: indciate the row number 
- tBodyAcc-X
- tBodyAcc-Y
- tBodyAcc-Z
- tBodyGyro-X
- tBodyGyro-Y
- tBodyGyro-Z

Each of the last six variables has a mean and standard version. For instance: 

tBodyAcc-mean()-Y: Mean of base body acceleration data in the Y dimension
